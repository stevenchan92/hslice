        <h5 class="text-left my-5" style="line-height:2em;">
            My kitchen is a mess. There's pots in the sink, half-chopped pork bones on the cutting board, 10 different Asian herbs spread all over the counter, and a few dried honey dates that rolled away from their packaging and scattered onto the linoleum floor. Shit, was I suppose to add that in earlier? 
        <br><br>    
            Ever since I moved to San Francisco, I've started to miss all the homemade dishes my parents and grandparents used to make: congees when I was sick, the savory soups before every meal, the Asian vegetables that you’d only find at Asian supermarkets. Moving from New York City was scary at first, I was used to my usual spots for good food, now I was navigating foreign territory, 2000 miles away from the nearest friend or relative. I started eating out at Asian restaurants, but it was only a temporary fix, I needed the real thing. I needed to cook these dishes myself with my own two hands, but I had no idea where to start. 
        <br><br>
            I called my mom the next day and asked her how to make one of my favorites, <i>Ching Po Leung</i> soup. I wrote down the list of ingredients, some instructions, and I was ready to start my food quest. Little did I know, <i>I was going to learn today.</i> I must’ve spent hours pacing back and forth, up and down the aisles of Sunset Super searching for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fox+nut+barley&hl=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzn_it4OPZAhWnv1QKHd-jDYYQsAQIKA&biw=1124&bih=618">fox nut barley(QIÀN SHÍ, 芡实)</a>? One Google Image Search and a barely coherent conversation with an older Cantonese lady later and it was in my basket, first ingredient, check.  
        <br><br>
            Once I had all the ingredients, I made it back to my place and started cooking. By my third try it still didn’t taste right, it was time to call mom for help. I forgot the chicken stock. But something magical happened on the next try. Ancient aromas danced around the kitchen like how my mom would when she was cooking dinner. Memories of watching Cartoon Network with my brother and the exciting shrill of “dinner’s ready” all started coming back to me. 
        <br><br>
            The dishes we ate growing up carry a richness and complexity that can't be captured in a single story. They are more than meals, they are beyond ourselves. They are a way to show we care, bring family together, and share the experiences of our parents and their parents and their homeland. They are a story about us. 
        <br><br>
            And so I'd like to welcome you to <a href="../index.html">Homeslice</a>, the same way my mom always greets me. 
        <br><br>
            <i>Did you eat yet?</i>
